## Specific Tasks

1. **Product Showcase:**
   - Create a layout that displays at least 5 products.
   - Each product should have an image, name, price, and brief description.
   - Use appropriate semantic HTML elements for structuring this information.

2. **Navigation:**
   - Include links to "Home", "Products", "About Us", and "Contact" sections.
   - Style the navigation menu to be responsive.

3. **Product Filter:**
   - Add a text input field that allows users to filter products by name.
   - Use JavaScript to show/hide products based on the user's input in real-time.

4. **Product Details:**
   - When a user clicks on a product, show more detailed information about that product.
   - This should be done dynamically with JavaScript, updating the DOM without reloading the page.

5. **Contact Form:**
   - Create a form with fields for Name, Email, and Message.
   - Use JavaScript to validate the form before submission.
   - Display error messages for invalid inputs.

6. **Product Comparison Table:**

7. **Color Toggle:**
   - For one product, add buttons that allow users to see the product in different colors.
   - Use JavaScript to change the product image or apply a color overlay when a color is selected.

8. **Image Slideshow:**
   - Implement a simple slideshow for product images.
   - Include "Previous" and "Next" buttons to navigate through the images.

9. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure that the layout adjusts appropriately for both desktop and mobile views.
   - Use media queries to adjust styles as needed.

10. **CSS Animation:**
    - Add a subtle animation effect to product images when hovering over them.

## Submission
Create a folder (Basic Knowledge Test Submission) within the Basic Knowledge Test folder 
1. `index.html`
2. `styles.css`
3. `script.js`
4. Be sure to include any necessary assets (images, videos) used in the project.


Good luck!
